accessor a list of types - and hence of [SUBSTOBJ][class] - and in the
[TERM][generic-function] a term - and hence an [STLC][type]. The formal grammar
of [LAMB][class] is:

```lisp
(lamb tdom term)
```

where we can possibly include type information by

```lisp
(lamb tdom term :ttype ttype)
```

The intended semantics are: [TDOM][generic-function] is a list of types (and
hence a list of [SUBSTOBJ][GEB.SPEC:SUBSTOBJ]) whose iterative product of
components form the domain of the function type. [TERM][generic-function]
is a term (and hence an [STLC][type]) of the codomain of the function type
gotten in the context to whom we append the list of the domains.

For a list of length 1, corresponds to the introduction rule of the function
type. Namely, given
$$\\Gamma \\vdash \\text{tdom : Type}$$ and
$$\\Gamma, \\text{tdom} \\vdash \\text{term : (ttype term)}$$ we have
$$\\Gamma \\vdash \\text{(lamb tdom term) : (so-hom-obj tdom (ttype term))}$$

For a list of length n, this corresponds to the iterated lambda type, e.g.

```lisp
(lamb (list so1 so0) (index 0))
```

is a term of

```lisp
(so-hom-obj (prod so1 so0) so0)
```

or equivalently

```lisp
(so-hom-obj so1 (so-hom-obj so0 so0))
```

due to Geb's computational definition of the function type.

Note that [INDEX][class] 0 in the above code is of type [SO1][class].
So that after annotating the term, one gets

```lisp
LAMBDA> (ttype (term (lamb (list so1 so0)) (index 0)))
s-1
```

So the counting of indices starts with the leftmost argument for
computational reasons. In practice, typing of [LAMB][class] corresponds with
taking a list of arguments provided to a lambda term, making it a context
in that order and then counting the index of the variable. Type-theoretically,

$$\\Gamma \\vdash \\lambda \\Delta (index i)$$
$$\\Delta, \\Gamma \\vdash (index i)$$

So that by the operational semantics of [INDEX][class], the type of (index i)
in the above context will be the i'th element of the Delta context counted from
the left. Note that in practice we append contexts on the left as computation of
[INDEX][class] is done from the left. Otherwise, the rules are the same as in
usual type theory if context was read from right to left."))
