# Geb Reading Group Syllabus

## Purpose

This document is intended to summarize the background, especially in category theory and polynomial functors, required to understand how Geb works.  It will serve as a guide to topics for the weekly reading group, and for attendees on how to prepare.

Practically none of the following is required just to write code in Geb!  But it is required to understand how the language works under the hood, and that would also enable a programmer to use more of it.

## Learning outline

The two main threads of theory underlying Geb are category theory and polynomial functors.  To some degree I am treating the former as the theory of (programming) languages and the latter as the theory of data structures, but in Geb they are intertwined, defined through mutual recursion:  category theory defined by data structures, data structures given semantics by category theory, and "(programming) language" emerging as a notion of its own (broader than "category").

### Track: category theory

Fortunately, but not just coincidentally, the aspects of category theory underpinning Geb are mainly the foundational ones -- the first few that are typically presented in books on category theory.  One of my aims in the reading group will be to communicate these foundations in terms that will be most familiar to programmers -- each of them has a clear analogue in and application to programming.

Here is a rough order of topics I'd recommend.
