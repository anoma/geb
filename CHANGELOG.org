* 0.3.0
** User Facing Changes
- _Lambda Changes_
  1. Types are no longer required on all terms
  2. Application and Lambda now take multiple arguments, and expect
     arguments uncurried
- _Core Category Changes_
  + Opaque types now extend the core category
- An interpreter now can be used from any category of the codebase
- Cleaner Code generation, through the new BITC backend.
** Bug Fixes
- Geb to Poly had a few bugs fixed in injection, and pair
  representations
- Geb no longer exhausts the stack when trying to generate out
  vampir for basic circuits.
** Internal Changes
- Reference extensions allow factoring out common parts, not used
  outside of poly.
- _We now have the following generic modules_
  1. =GEB.GENERICS= - which hosts all generic transformations
  2. =GEB.EXTENSION= - which holds all extensions
- We have streamlined the package loading order.
* 0.2.0
- Change the graphing from a box and line diagram, to a proper graph diagram.
  + We now utilize clim-dot to draw the graph.
- The drawing algorithm improved, new algorithms to optimize the
  graphing diagram.
- Change design of the codebase to use mixin based extension to the
  core category instead of extending substmorph/substobj.
- Removed the alias tag, instead it's now stored on each separate
  allocation!
- _Fixups_
  + Vamp-IR name dumping when using CL variable name convention
    ignores *'s.
  + Minor issue with the docs on unresolved references and unneeded
    aliases preventing stock SBCL from loading the codebase.
* 0.1.1-alpha
- Fixup Vamp-IR library dump, by having range generate proper code.
* 0.1.0-alpha
