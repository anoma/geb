# (Co)End Formulas and Universal Properties Research

This document tracks research on the categorical semantics of restricted
and weighted (co)wedges, their relationship to well-known (co)end formulas,
and open questions about their structure.

## Overview

We have characterized three levels of (co)wedge structures as standard
(co)wedges over particular profunctors:

| Construction | Profunctor | (Co)End Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WeightedCowedge W G` | `copowerWeightedProfunctor` | `∫^j W(j) × G(j)` |
| `WeightedWedge W G` | `powerWeightedProfunctor` | `∫_j [W(j), G(j)]` |
| `StrongRestrictedCowedge G H` | `diagElemProf G H` | `colim_{DiagElem H}` |
| `StrongRestrictedWedge G H` | `diagElemProf G H` | `lim_{DiagElem H}` |
| `RestrictedCowedge G H` | `copowerProfunctorProfArg` | `∫^I H(I,I) × G(I,I)` |
| `RestrictedWedge G H` | `powerProfunctorProfArg` | `∫_I [H(I,I), G(I,I)]` |

## Well-Known Formula Correspondences

### WeightedWedge/Cowedge = Weighted (Co)Limits

The most direct correspondence. The standard weighted (co)limit formulas:

- Weighted colimit: `W * F ≅ ∫^{j∈J} W(j) ⋅ F(j)`
- Weighted limit: `{W, F} ≅ ∫_{j∈J} [W(j), F(j)]`

Our constructions:

- `copowerWeightedProfunctor W G` at `j` = `W(j) × G(j)`
- `powerWeightedProfunctor W G` at `j` = `W(j) → G(j)`

These match exactly. WeightedWedge/WeightedCowedge are weighted
limits/colimits expressed via their end/coend formulas.

### StrongRestrictedWedge/Cowedge = (Co)Limits over Category of Elements

Standard result: weighted colimits can be expressed as ordinary colimits
over the category of elements:

`W * F = colim_{(j,w) : El(W)} F(j)`

Our construction:

- `diagElemProf G H = profPullback G (DiagElem.forget H)`
- Coend: `∫^{(A,a) : DiagElem H} G(A,A) = colim_{DiagElem H} (G ∘ forget)`

This is the **structural coend** from Neumann's Paranatural Category
Theory. The paranaturality condition on morphisms in `DiagElem H` ensures
the correct quotient.

### RestrictedWedge/Cowedge = Vene's Restricted (Co)Ends

The formulas:

- End: `∫_I [H(I,I), G(I,I)]` (pointwise power on diagonal)
- Coend: `∫^I H(I,I) × G(I,I)` (pointwise copower on diagonal)

This is a "profunctor-weighted" (co)end where both weight and diagram are
profunctors, integrated only over the diagonal. The universal object is
Vene's restricted coend `Σ(H,G)` for Mendler-style recursion.

### Kan Extension Connection

The left Kan extension formula:

`(Lan_K F)(c) = ∫^d C(K(d), c) × F(d)`

For `K = DiagElem.forget H` and the terminal functor `! : DiagElem H → 1`:

`Lan_! (G ∘ forget) = colim_{DiagElem H} (G ∘ forget) = CostructureIntegral H G`

So `CostructureIntegral H G` is the left Kan extension of the diagonal
restriction of `G` along the terminal functor.

## Open Research Questions

### Q1: Kan Extensions, Adjoints, and Initial Algebras

**Background**: If a functor `U` has a left adjoint `F`, then `F` is the
right Kan extension of the identity along `U`, preserved by `U`:

`F ≅ Ran_U Id` and `U` preserves this Kan extension.

**Observation**: Categories of algebras can be expressed as diagonal element
categories. For a functor `G : C → C`:

- `G-Alg ≌ DiagElem (AlgProf G)`
- The forgetful functor `U : G-Alg → C` corresponds to `DiagElem.forget`
- When `U` has a left adjoint (free algebra), that adjoint is `Ran_U Id`

**Question**: Is there a precise correspondence between:

1. `StructuralEnd (AlgProf G)` (which gives the initial algebra carrier)
2. `Ran_{DiagElem.forget} Id` (right Kan extension of identity on algebras)

The StructuralEnd is a limit over `DiagElem (AlgProf G)`. If the forgetful
functor has a left adjoint (free monad), then `Ran_U Id` exists and equals
that adjoint. How do these constructions relate?

**Conjecture**: The carrier of the initial algebra (obtained from
StructuralEnd) should be connected to the right Kan extension of the
identity functor on the algebra category along the forgetful functor,
evaluated at the initial algebra itself.

**Analysis sketch**:

The right Kan extension formula is:

`(Ran_U Id)(c) = ∫_{(A,α) : G-Alg} [C(c, U(A,α)), (A,α)]`

When this end exists, it gives for each `c : C` the "universal" algebra
whose carrier maps from `c`. At `c = μG.a` (initial algebra carrier):

`(Ran_U Id)(μG.a) = ∫_{(A,α)} [C(μG.a, A), (A,α)]`

Since `μG` is initial, `C(μG.a, A) ≅ G-Alg(μG, (A,α))` (the unique algebra
morphism). So this end computes "the algebra that receives a unique map
from every algebra" — which is the initial algebra itself.

Meanwhile, `StructuralEnd (AlgProf G)` computes:

`∫_{(A,α) : DiagElem(AlgProf G)} A`

This is the equalizer of two maps involving the algebra actions. The
universal property says: an element `x : StructuralEnd` gives, for each
algebra `(A,α)`, an element of `A` that is "paranatural" in the algebra.

**Connection hypothesis**: The StructuralEnd gives the carrier of the
object that `Ran_U Id` produces at the initial algebra. The paranaturality
condition captures the same universal property as the Kan extension, but
expressed "pointwise" via diagonal elements rather than via the end over
hom-objects.

**To investigate**:

- The precise relationship between structural ends and Kan extensions
- Whether the universal property of StructuralEnd can be derived from
  Kan extension universal properties
- The role of the free monad in this picture
- Whether there's a general theorem: `StructuralEnd F ≅ (Ran_U Id)(μ).a`
  where `μ` is the initial object

### Q2: Transfer of Terminality/Initiality Across Inclusions

We have a hierarchy of categories with inclusions:

```text
WeightedWedge ──(faithful, not full)──> StrongRestrictedWedge
                                              │
                                        (fully faithful)
                                              │
                                              v
                                       RestrictedWedge
```

**Known results**:

1. `StrongRestrictedWedge.inclusion : StrongRestrictedWedge → RestrictedWedge`
   is fully faithful.
2. `strongRestrictionFunctor : WeightedWedge → StrongRestrictedWedge` is
   faithful but NOT full.

#### Formalized: Fully Faithful Case

**General theorem for full subcategories**: If `F : C → D` is fully
faithful and `F(c)` is terminal in `D`, then `c` is terminal in `C`.

**Formalized in `GebLean/Weighted.lean`**:

```lean
def isStrongRestrictedEnd_of_isRestrictedEnd
    (G : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ C ⥤ D) (H : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ C ⥤ Type v)
    (c : StrongRestrictedWedge G H)
    (h : IsRestrictedEnd G H c.toRestrictedWedge) :
    IsStrongRestrictedEnd G H c

def isStrongRestrictedCoend_of_isRestrictedCoend
    (G : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ C ⥤ D) (H : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ C ⥤ Type v)
    (c : StrongRestrictedCowedge G H)
    (h : IsRestrictedCoend G H c.toRestrictedCowedge) :
    IsStrongRestrictedCoend G H c
```

These use the explicit preimage from `inclusion_fullyFaithful` to remain
computable (avoiding mathlib's `Functor.preimage`).

#### Non-Full Case: Condition on Profunctors

**Question for non-full inclusions**: Under what conditions can terminality
transfer from `StrongRestrictedWedge` to `WeightedWedge`?

##### Identified Condition: Weight Maps Jointly Surjective

For the restriction functor to be full (and thus for terminality to
transfer automatically), the weight maps from diagonals must be jointly
surjective. Formally:

For every co-twisted arrow `tw` and weight element `w ∈ H(tw)`, there
should exist:

- An identity co-twisted arrow `id(A)` for some object `A`
- A morphism `m : tw → id(A)` in `CoTwistedArrow C`
- A diagonal weight element `w' ∈ diagApp H A`
- Such that `H.map m.op w' = w`

**Theorem (`commutativity_from_identity_image`)**: If a morphism commutes
with legs at identity co-twisted arrows, it also commutes at weight
elements in the image of weight maps from diagonals.

**Consequence**: When weight maps are jointly surjective, every morphism
in `StrongRestrictedCowedge` lifts to `WeightedCowedge`, making the
restriction functor full and enabling automatic transfer.

#### Counterexample: WalkingParallelPair

**Theorem (`wpp_weight_maps_not_surjective`)**: For `WalkingParallelPair`
with the Hom-profunctor, weight maps from diagonals are NOT jointly
surjective.

The category `WalkingParallelPair` has:

- Objects: `zero`, `one`
- Morphisms: `left, right : zero ⟶ one` plus identities

For the Hom-profunctor:

- `Hom(zero, zero) = {id}` (singleton)
- `Hom(one, one) = {id}` (singleton)
- `Hom(zero, one) = {left, right}` (two elements)

Weight maps from diagonals both send to `left`:

- `id_zero ≫ left = left`
- `left ≫ id_one = left`

This leaves `right` unreachable from any diagonal.

**Theorem (`cValued_strongRestrictionFunctor_not_full`)**: The strong
restriction functor is not full for this profunctor.

#### Summary

| Inclusion | Full? | Transfer of Terminal/Initial |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Strong → Restricted` | Y | Automatic |
| `Weighted → Strong` | N (in general) | If: weight maps jointly surjective |

**Dual**: The same analysis applies for initial objects and cowedges.

### Q3: 2-Categorical Structure from Composability

**Background**:

- Paranatural transformations compose (unlike dinatural transformations).
- Natural transformations also compose (as in WeightedWedge/Cowedge).
- Dinatural transformations generally do NOT compose.

**Observation**: `StrongRestrictedWedge` and `WeightedWedge` both involve
composable transformation types, while `RestrictedWedge` does not.

**Question**: Does composability enable additional 2-categorical structure
on `StrongRestrictedWedge`/`WeightedWedge` that is unavailable for
`RestrictedWedge`?

**Possible structures to investigate**:

1. **2-cells between wedge morphisms**: Can we define natural
   transformations or modifications between wedge morphisms?
2. **Horizontal composition**: Given wedges `w₁, w₂, w₃` and morphisms
   `f : w₁ → w₂`, `g : w₂ → w₃`, the composite `g ∘ f` exists. But is
   there meaningful horizontal composition?
3. **Bicategorical structure**: Could the categories of strong restricted
   or weighted (co)wedges form bicategories with appropriate 2-cells?
4. **Double categorical structure**: The combination of profunctor
   composition and (co)wedge morphisms might form a double category.

**Connection to paranaturality**:

- Paranatural transformations form a category `Para(C)` with composition.
- This category has its own (co)limits and universal properties.
- The structural (co)ends are computed in this category.
- Does the 2-categorical structure of `Para(C)` (if any) induce structure
  on `StrongRestrictedWedge`/`Cowedge`?

**Contrast with RestrictedWedge**:

- Dinatural transformations do not compose in general.
- The category `RestrictedWedge` has objects and morphisms, but the
  morphisms are just apex morphisms satisfying compatibility.
- There may be no natural notion of 2-cell.

**Analysis: Para(C) as a 2-category?**

The category `Para(C)` of profunctors and paranatural transformations:

- 0-cells: Objects of C (or perhaps profunctors C^op × C → Set)
- 1-cells: Paranatural transformations
- 2-cells: ???

For `Para(C)` to be a 2-category, we'd need "modifications" between
paranatural transformations. A modification `m : α ⇒ β` between
`α, β : F → G` would be a family of morphisms satisfying coherence.

**Observation**: In the standard setting, modifications between natural
transformations exist (giving Cat as a 2-category). The question is whether
analogous modifications exist for paranaturals.

**Potential 2-categorical structure on StrongRestrictedWedge**:

Given wedges `w₁, w₂ : StrongRestrictedWedge G H` with the same apex `pt`,
a 2-cell `w₁ ⇒ w₂` could be a family witnessing that the two paranatural
families are "related" in some coherent way.

Since both families are `pt → G(A,A)` for each `A` and `a : H(A,A)`, a
2-cell might be a "homotopy" between them — but in Set, this would just
mean equality.

**Higher structure might appear**:

1. If we work in a category with non-trivial 2-cells (like Cat or a
   2-category), then modifications would give genuine 2-categorical
   structure.

2. The profunctor bicategory `Prof` has profunctors as 1-cells and
   natural transformations as 2-cells. The composition of paranaturals
   might fit into this framework.

3. Double categorical structure: with profunctors horizontally, objects
   vertically, and (co)wedge morphisms as squares.

**To investigate**:

- Whether `Para(C)` admits a natural 2-category structure
- Whether StrongRestrictedWedge inherits this structure
- Connection to the profunctor bicategory `Prof`
- Possible double categorical structures

### Comparison Maps (Task #46)

Since `StrongRestricted → Restricted` is fully faithful, initiality in the
larger category (RestrictedCowedge) implies initiality in the smaller
category (StrongRestrictedCowedge). This gives a canonical comparison map:

`Σ(H,G) → CostructureIntegral H G`

(from the initial RestrictedCowedge to the initial StrongRestrictedCowedge)

**Question**: Is this comparison an isomorphism?

**Answer**: NO, not in general.

#### Analysis

The comparison map exists by initiality of `Σ(H,G)`. For it to be an
isomorphism, `CostructureIntegral H G` would also need to be initial in
`RestrictedCowedge`.

A morphism `h : CostructureIntegral H G → c.pt` (for RestrictedCowedge `c`)
must satisfy:

```lean
h (CostructureIntegral.mk ⟨A, a⟩ g) = c.family A a g
```

This uniquely determines `h` on generators. But `CostructureIntegral` is a
quotient by the **paranaturality** relation, which identifies:

```text
mk x (contravAction f ψ) ~ mk y (covAction f ψ)
```

for morphisms `f : x → y` in `DiagElem H`.

For `h` to be well-defined, the target `c` must respect this identification.
A merely **dinatural** family doesn't necessarily satisfy this stronger
condition.

#### Counterexample: WalkingParallelPair with Constant Profunctor

**Setup**:

- `C = WalkingParallelPair` (objects: `zero`, `one`; morphisms: `left, right`)
- `H = Hom` profunctor
- `G = const T` (constant profunctor at some type T)

**DiagElem H**:

- Objects: `(zero, id_zero)` and `(one, id_one)`
- Morphisms: `(zero, id_zero) → (one, id_one)` via `left` and `right`

**CostructureIntegral H G** (initial StrongRestrictedCowedge):

- Generators: `(zero, t)` and `(one, t)` for `t : T`
- Paranaturality quotient: since there exist morphisms in DiagElem H from
  `(zero, id_zero)` to `(one, id_one)`, and G is constant (so contrav/cov
  actions are identity), we get `(zero, t) ~ (one, t)` for all `t`
- Result: **CostructureIntegral ≅ T**

**Initial RestrictedCowedge** (Vene's `Σ(H,G)`):

- Dinaturality at `left, right : zero → one` involves elements of
  `H(one, zero) = ∅` (no morphisms from one to zero)
- So dinaturality is **vacuously satisfied** - no identifications!
- Result: **Σ(H,G) ≅ T + T** (disjoint union)

**Conclusion**: For non-empty `T`, we have `T ≇ T + T`, so the comparison
map `T + T → T` is NOT an isomorphism. It's a surjection (collapsing two
copies), not an injection.

#### When Do They Coincide?

The comparison map is an isomorphism when every dinaturality identification
is also a paranaturality identification. This happens when:

1. **H(one, zero) generates enough identifications**: The off-diagonal
   elements used in dinaturality must generate the same equivalence as
   the DiagElem morphisms used in paranaturality.

2. **DiagElem H has no non-trivial morphisms**: If DiagElem H is discrete
   (only identity morphisms), then paranaturality adds no identifications
   beyond dinaturality.

3. **G is "faithful enough"**: If the contrav/cov actions of G distinguish
   elements that are related by DiagElem morphisms, then paranaturality
   may collapse to dinaturality.
