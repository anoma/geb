# Workstream: Twisted Arrow Categories as Grothendieck Constructions

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This workstream explores the relationship between twisted arrow categories and
Grothendieck constructions. The goal is to express each of the four twisted
arrow variants as a Grothendieck construction over slice/coslice categories,
which would enable cleaner functor constructions by leveraging existing
`FunctorFromData` infrastructure.

## Analysis

### Twisted Arrow Category Structure

The twisted arrow category `TwistedArrow' C` has:

- Objects: `(x, y, f : x ⟶ y)` - morphisms in C
- Morphisms `(x, y, f) → (x', y', f')`:
  - `domArr : x' ⟶ x` (backwards on domain)
  - `codArr : y ⟶ y'` (forwards on codomain)
  - Commutativity: `domArr ≫ f ≫ codArr = f'`

### Key Finding: TwistedArrow' C ≅ Grothendieck(Under : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat)

The twisted arrow category is isomorphic to the Grothendieck construction of
the Under functor:

**Under functor**: `Under : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat`

- `Under.obj (op x) = Under x` (category of arrows out of x)
- `Under.map (op domArr) : Under x ⥤ Under x'` for `domArr : x' ⟶ x`
  via precomposition: `(y, f : x ⟶ y) ↦ (y, domArr ≫ f : x' ⟶ y)`

**Grothendieck(Under)** has:

- Objects: `(op x, (y, f : x ⟶ y))`
- Morphisms `(op x, f) → (op x', f')`:
  - Base: `op domArr : op x ⟶ op x'` in Cᵒᵖ (i.e., `domArr : x' ⟶ x` in C)
  - Fiber: `(y, domArr ≫ f) ⟶ (y', f')` in Under x'
    which is `codArr : y ⟶ y'` with `domArr ≫ f ≫ codArr = f'`

This exactly matches `TwistedArrow' C`.

### The Four Variants

The four twisted arrow variants arise from two binary choices:

1. **Base indexing**: Domain (Under) vs Codomain (Over)
2. **Grothendieck variance**: Covariant vs Contravariant

| Variant | Base | Grothendieck | domArr direction | codArr direction |
|---------|------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| TwistedArrow' C | Under (domain) | Covariant | backwards | forwards |
| Grothendieck(Over) | Over (codomain) | Covariant | forwards | forwards |
| GrothendieckContra(Under') | Under | Contravariant | forwards | backwards |
| GrothendieckContra(Over') | Over | Contravariant | backwards | backwards |

### Detailed Analysis of Each Variant

#### 1. TwistedArrow' C = Grothendieck(Under : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat)

- Domain x is base (indexed contravariantly via Cᵒᵖ)
- `domArr : x' ⟶ x` backwards, `codArr : y ⟶ y'` forwards
- Commutativity: `domArr ≫ f ≫ codArr = f'`

#### 2. Grothendieck(Over : C ⥤ Cat)

- Codomain y is base (indexed covariantly)
- `domArr : x ⟶ x'` forwards, `codArr : y ⟶ y'` forwards
- Commutativity: `domArr ≫ f' = f ≫ codArr`
- This is related to `(TwistedArrow' C)ᵒᵖ` via the isomorphism that swaps the
  direction of morphisms

#### 3. GrothendieckContra(Under' : C ⥤ Cat)

- Would require Under viewed as a C-indexed functor (not Cᵒᵖ)
- Fiber morphisms go "against" the transport direction
- Results in: `domArr : x ⟶ x'` forwards, `codArr : y' ⟶ y` backwards

#### 4. GrothendieckContra(Over' : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat)

- Over viewed as Cᵒᵖ-indexed
- Fiber morphisms go "against" the transport direction
- Results in: `domArr : x' ⟶ x` backwards, `codArr : y' ⟶ y` backwards

### Duality Between Over and Under

The Over and Under categories are dual in the following sense:

- `Over y` = arrows INTO y = `Under(Cᵒᵖ).obj (op y)`
- `Under x` = arrows FROM x = `Over(Cᵒᵖ).obj (op x)`

This explains why:

- TwistedArrow' C uses Under (domain-indexed, backwards domArr)
- The "opposite" twisted arrow uses Over (codomain-indexed, forwards domArr)

## Implications for Functor Factorization

### The Factorization Strategy

A functor `TwistedArrow' C ⥤ Type v` can be factored as:

```text
TwistedArrow' C ──equiv──▶ Grothendieck(Under) ──functorFrom──▶ Type v
```

Where:

1. **equiv**: The isomorphism `TwistedArrow' C ≅ Grothendieck(Under : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat)`
2. **functorFrom**: A functor FROM the Grothendieck construction using
   `FunctorFromData`

### FunctorFromData for Under

The `FunctorFromData` structure for `Under : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat` consists of:

- `fib : ∀ x, Under x ⥤ Type v` - a functor from each coslice category
- `hom : ∀ (domArr : x' ⟶ x), fib x ⟶ Under.map domArr ⋙ fib x'`
- `hom_id`, `hom_comp` - coherence conditions

The key benefit: `FunctorFromData.functorFromData` already has proven functor
laws (`map_id`, `map_comp`), so the eqToHom management is handled once in that
general construction.

### Contravariant Fibers

Our slice data has contravariant fibers: `fib y : (Over y)ᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v`
(presheaves on slices). For the Under-based formulation, we need:

`fib x : (Under x)ᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v` or equivalently `fib x : Under x ⥤ Type v` with
appropriate variance handling.

This may require:

1. A `FunctorFromContraFibData` variant where fibers are contravariant
2. Or careful use of opposite categories in the base functor

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Establish Equivalences

- [ ] Define `underMapFunctor : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat` (if not already in mathlib)
- [ ] Prove `TwistedArrow' C ≅ Grothendieck(underMapFunctor)`
- [ ] Similarly for the other three variants

### Phase 2: FunctorFromData with Contravariant Fibers

- [ ] Define `FunctorFromContraFibData` for functors with contravariant fibers
- [ ] Prove the functor laws for `functorFromContraFibData`
- [ ] Show this generalizes the existing `FunctorFromData`

### Phase 3: Refactor Twisted Arrow Presheaves

- [ ] Express `TwArrCopresheaf` slice data as `FunctorFromContraFibData`
- [ ] Factor the functor construction through the equivalence
- [ ] Verify the functor laws follow from the general construction

### Phase 4: Other Variants

- [ ] Apply the same factorization to `TwArrPresheaf`
- [ ] Apply to `TwArrOpCopresheaf` and `TwArrOpPresheaf`

## Connection to Existing Work

This builds on the Grothendieck functor factorization workstream:

- `SectionData` captures sections of `forget : Grothendieck F ⥤ C`
- `FunctorToData` decomposes as base functor + section data
- `FunctorFromData` captures functors FROM Grothendieck constructions

The new insight is that twisted arrow categories ARE Grothendieck constructions
over Under/Over, so the existing infrastructure applies directly.

## Open Questions

1. What is the precise relationship between `Grothendieck(Over)` and
   `(TwistedArrow' C)ᵒᵖ`?

2. Can we unify all four variants under a single parameterized construction?

3. Does mathlib already have the `underMapFunctor : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Cat`? If not, what's
   the cleanest way to define it?
