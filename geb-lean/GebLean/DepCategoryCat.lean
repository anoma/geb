# The Category of Categories as a Full Subcategory of DepCategoryData

This file shows that `Cat` (the category of categories) embeds as a full
subcategory into `DepCategoryData`.

## Overview

The category `DepCategoryData` with `DepNatTransData` morphisms is equivalent
to the category of copresheaves on `CategoryJudgments.Obj`. This copresheaf
category contains all "potential" category structures, including ones that
do not satisfy the category axioms.

The category `Cat` of small categories embeds into `DepCategoryData` as
those objects where:
- Identity witnesses exist and are unique for each object
- Composition witnesses exist and are unique for each composable pair
- The identity and associativity laws hold

## Main definitions

* `catToDepCategoryData`: Converts a category to DepCategoryData by encoding
  the category structure as dependent types where identity and composition
  witnesses are propositions (subtypes witnessing equality)

* `functorToDepNatTrans`: Converts a functor between categories to a
  DepNatTransData morphism between the corresponding DepCategoryData

* `catEmbedding`: The functor `Cat ⥤ DepCategoryData` that embeds
  categories into dependent category data

* `catEmbedding.faithful`: Proof that the embedding is faithful (injective
  on morphisms)

* `catEmbedding.full`: Proof that the embedding is full (surjective on
  morphisms between objects in the image)

## Mathematical content

A category `C` is converted to `DepCategoryData` as follows:
- `objT` = the objects of `C`
- `morT a b` = morphisms from `a` to `b` in `C`
- `idT m` = proof that `m` is the identity morphism (i.e., `m = 𝟙 _`)
- `compT f g h` = proof that `h = f ≫ g`

A functor `F : C ⥤ D` induces `DepNatTransData` with:
- `appObj` = the object function of `F`
- `appMor` = the morphism function of `F`
- `appId` = proof preservation (uses that `F` preserves identities)
- `appComp` = proof preservation (uses that `F` preserves composition)

The embedding is full because any `DepNatTransData` between categories
(when viewed as `DepCategoryData`) must preserve the identity and
composition structure, which exactly characterizes functors.
