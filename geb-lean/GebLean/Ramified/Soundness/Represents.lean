# The representation relation

The logical relation `Represents` tying a closed source term of the
object-sorted applicative calculus `RλMR_o^ω` (`GebLean/Ramified/Soundness/
Applicative.lean`) to a closed term of the simply-typed calculus `1λ(A)`
(`GebLean/Ramified/Soundness/OneLambda.lean`) that computes its value, following
Leivant III section 4.2 (p. 223). Defined by structural recursion on the r-type
`τ` (via `PolyFix.ind`, decision 8): at the object sorts `o` and `Ω τ'` a closed
term `Fhat` represents `F` when `Fhat` reduces to the Berarducci-Böhm value term of
`F`'s denotation, and at an arrow `σ → τ'` representation is the logical-relation
implication carrying represented arguments to represented applications.

## Main definitions

* `sourceApp` — closed-term application of the object-sorted applicative
  calculus, the empty-context specialization of `Ramified.app'`.
* `Represents` — the representation relation of Leivant III section 4.2.
* `RepresentsEnv` — two closing environments related pointwise through
  `Represents`, the hypothesis of Lemma 10.
* `LamFree` — the variable-application (λ-free, recur-free, constant-free)
  fragment over which Lemma 10 quantifies.

## Main statements

* `lemma8` — target-reduction closure of `Represents` (Leivant III section 4.2,
  Lemma 8): a `1λ(A)` reduction may be prepended to a representative.
* `lemma9_o`, `lemma9_omega` — self-representation of a closed source term at
  the object sorts (Leivant III section 4.2, Lemma 9, weakened): a closed term
  is represented by the canonical bar-term of its own denotation.
* `lemma10` — the fundamental lemma of `Represents` restricted to the λ-free
  terms (Leivant III section 4.2, Lemma 10): substituting represented terms for
  the free variables of a λ-free term yields a represented substitution into its
  bar image.
* `sub_app'`, `OneLambda.sub_app'`, `barTm_app'`, `barTm_var`, `barTm_op`,
  `represents_arrow` — the substitution/bar-map distribution and relation-
  unfolding facts the Lemma 10 induction consumes; `sub_underBinder_nil` and
  `weakAppend_nil` are the empty-binder coherence they rest on. `barTm_op` is
  the general operation-node reduction of the term bar-map (`barTm_var` and
  `barTm_app'` are its leaf and application instances).
* `recurBridge` — the source-side recurrence semantics of Proposition 11's
  recurrence case (Leivant III section 4.2–4.3): the denotation of a saturated
  recurrence combinator applied to an argument is the free-algebra recurrence of
  the argument's denotation.
* `represents_app` — the application case of Proposition 11's fundamental
  induction (Leivant III section 4.2–4.3), standalone: representation of a
  substituted function and argument yields representation of the substituted
  application.
* `barRecur_appSpine_reduces` — the recurrence bar-map saturated with represented
  step terms reduces to its instantiated inner body, the recurrence-combinator
  counterpart of `OneLambda.bbRep_appSpine_reduces`.

## Implementation notes

`Represents` is a decision-2 denotational reformulation of Leivant III section
4.2's operational `Represents`: the object and `Ω` clauses anchor the source
value denotationally through `appEval` rather than by measuring a source-side
reduction, since the source side is never measured downstream and `appEval` is
total and ties to `RIdent.interp` via `prop7Translate_interp`. This is novel
packaging (an approved internal-lemma deviation), not a verbatim transcription.

The relation is `Prop`-valued, so decision 8's requirement that recursive data be
a `PolyFix` W-type does not constrain it; the `PolyFix.ind` recursion carries a
dependent motive `fun {_} (t : RType) => Tm [] t → Tm [] (barTy t) → Prop`, and
the arrow clause recurses into both children through the eliminator's induction
hypothesis. The source-side application transports `F` across the node
reconstruction `arrow_node_eq`, since a term-valued position cannot avoid the
transport the way `RType.interp` (a `Type`-valued recursion) does. The
object-clause denotations `appEval F finZeroElim` supply the empty semantic
environment at the empty context through `finZeroElim`, the dependent empty
eliminator, rather than the non-dependent `Fin.elim0`, which does not match the
dependent environment Pi.

/-- The representation relation of the bar-translation (Leivant III section 4.2,
p. 223), a decision-2 denotational reformulation: a closed source term `F` of the
object-sorted applicative calculus at r-type `τ` is represented by a closed term
`Fhat` of the simply-typed calculus `1λ(A)` at the barred type `barTy τ` when

* at the base sort `o`, `Fhat` reduces (`OneLambdaStep`, reflexive-transitively) to
  the concrete `o`-term `conc` of `F`'s denotation `appEval F finZeroElim`;
* at an object sort `Ω τ'`, `Fhat` reduces to the Berarducci-Böhm representation
  `bbRep` of `F`'s denotation at the barred sort `barTy τ'`;
* at an arrow `σ → τ'`, `Fhat` represents `F` exactly when it carries every
  represented argument to a represented application — the logical-relation
  clause, recursing into both arrow children.

/-- Target-reduction closure of `Represents` (Leivant III section 4.2, Lemma 8),
a decision-2 denotational reformulation: a `1λ(A)` reduction may be prepended to a
representative. If `Fhat` represents `F` at r-type `τ` and `Fhat'` reduces to
`Fhat` (`OneLambdaStep`, reflexive-transitively), then `Fhat'` also represents `F`.

Because the source side is read only through `appEval` (decision 2), no source
metatheory is required: at the object sorts `o` and `Ω τ'` closure is target
transitivity of the reduction to the anchoring value, and at an arrow the reduction
is carried under the application spine by `OneLambda.reduces_app'_left` before the
recursion. Proved by the dependent eliminator `PolyFix.ind` (decision 8) on `τ`

9 additionally asserts that this representative is the *unique* normal `1λ(A)`
term representing `F`; under decision 2's denotational reformulation that
uniqueness content is dropped as unneeded (`Prop11` case 7 reads `F̂`'s normal
form from the `Represents` hypothesis directly, not from this lemma). What
remains is existence, and at `o` the object clause of `Represents` *is* the
statement that its target reduces to this term, so the anchor represents

/-- The variable-application fragment of the λ-free terms of the applicative
calculus `RλMR_o^ω` (Leivant III section 4.2, the terms Lemma 10 quantifies
over, as consumed by Proposition 11's recurrence case): a term built from
variables by application alone, with no λ-abstraction (`lam`), no recurrence
combinator (`recur`), and no object constant (`con`, `dstr`, `case`).

This is precisely the fragment Proposition 11's recurrence case substitutes
into. There, the Berarducci-Böhm representation `bbRep a τ̄` of a recurrence
argument's value, applied to represented step terms, reduces to the value's
constructor template `a{g⃗}` — an application spine over the bound constructor
variables, hence a variable-application term. Proposition 11's other cases
(`con^o`, `case`/`dstr`, `con^{Ωτ}`) discharge the object constants directly,
not through Lemma 10, and `recur`'s compatibility is the separate recurrence
bridge; so the object constants are absent from the terms Lemma 10 serves and
are excluded from this predicate. -/

/-- The fundamental lemma of the representation relation restricted to the
λ-free terms (Leivant III section 4.2, Lemma 10, a decision-2 denotational
reformulation): substituting represented closed terms for the free variables of
a λ-free term `E` produces, on the source side, a term represented by the
parallel target-side substitution into the bar image `barTm E`. Given closing
environments `Eσ` and `Eσhat` that are pointwise `Represents`-related
(`RepresentsEnv`), `sub Eσ E` is represented by `sub Eσhat (barTm E)`.

Proved by induction on the λ-free derivation. At a variable the two sides read
the related environments (`sub_var`, `barTm_var`), closed by the environment
hypothesis. At an application, substitution distributes over both application
nodes (`sub_app'`, `OneLambda.sub_app'`) and the bar-map sends the node to the
`1λ(A)` application (`barTm_app'`), so the arrow clause of `Represents`
(`represents_arrow`) applied to the two induction hypotheses closes the goal.

This is the fragment consumed by Proposition 11's recurrence case: the term `E`
ranges over the variable-application value templates of the Berarducci-Böhm
representation, whose object constants and recurrence combinator are handled
elsewhere (see `LamFree`). -/

source-side semantics the recurrence case of Proposition 11 consumes: the

/-- Compatibility of the representation relation with a destructor constant
(Leivant III section 4.2, Proposition 11's destructor case, a decision-2
denotational reformulation): the destructor node `dstr_j` is represented by the
parallel target substitution into its bar image `dstr_j` of `1λ(A)`. The nullary
node is fixed by both substitutions; the base destructor bar image needs no
transport (`barTmOp_dstr`), and on a represented argument the applied destructor
reduces to the concrete term of the destructed subterm through the shared
concrete-reduction lemma `conc_app_dstr_reduces`, after casing the argument's
value on its top constructor (`PolyFix.ind`). -/

/-- Compatibility of the representation relation with a shifted constructor
constant (Leivant III section 4.2, Proposition 11's `con^{Ωτ}` case, a decision-2
denotational reformulation): the constructor node `con^{Ωτ}_b` is represented by
the parallel target substitution into its bar image `barConOmega b τ` of `1λ(A)`.
The nullary node is fixed on the source side (`sub` over `elim0`) and mapped to
the constructor bar-map on the target side (`barTmOp_con_omega`, whose result-sort
transport vanishes at the concrete constructors of `natAlgSig`, then
`sub_barConOmega`). The zero-arity constructor's bar image is definitionally the
Berarducci-Böhm representation of its own denotation, so it represents itself
reflexively; the unary constructor peels its argument with `represents_arrow`,
reads the applied denotation as the semantic node (`appEval_app'`,
`stdConstructorInterp`), and closes by the saturation keystone
(`barConOmega_app_reduces`, through `barConOmega_true_fold`). -/
