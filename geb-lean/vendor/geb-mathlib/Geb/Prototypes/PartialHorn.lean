# Partial Horn logic

The logic of partial Horn theories over rose trees: signatures of partial operations, terms,
models, a checker of certificates proved sound in every model of a theory and complete by the
term model, developments of certificates that cite the theorems before them, definitional
extensions of theories, the one-point model, and certificates over a store of shared terms. The
metalogic's presentation of the free elementary topos is a partial Horn theory.
