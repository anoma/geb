# The internal language of the topos

The Mitchell–Bénabou language of the free elementary topos with data objects: its terms, with the
functor and monad laws of their renaming and substitution, their typing and compilation to the
combinators, its definitions, compiled to definitions of the
combinators, and the proof that compiling a term and unfolding the combinators' definitions
agrees, in every model, with unfolding the language's definitions and compiling; its derivations
of formulas under hypotheses, their checker and a prover, and the proofs that the checker is
sound and, citing certificates of the combinators, complete; its connectives, defined from
equality, with their rules derived, their meaning in every model, and description; and the
representation of Lean's functions by its terms in the topos of types and functional relations.
